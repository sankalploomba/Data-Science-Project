# Data-Science-Project
I made a project in Data Science where I performed Sentiment Analysis on Tweets during the COVID-19 Pandemic period.

For this project, I used R scripting language and TwitteR package which fetched Tweets using Twitter API at runtime. The tweets I analyzed were all on National Lockdown in India during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Using techniques of Web-Scraping, Supervised Learning and Sentiment Analysis, I aimed to analyze and visualize people's view of the National Lockdown, so that I could summarize the people's temperament towards the National Lockdown in India.

In doing this project, I got a chance to put all that I studied to practical use and I really enjoyed doing so.
