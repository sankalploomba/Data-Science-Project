# Data-Science-Project
I made a project in Data Science where I performed Sentiment Analysis on Tweets during the COVID-19 Pandemic period.

I used R scripting language and TwitteR package for this project. The tweets I analyzed were all on National Lockdown in India during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

By using techniques of Supervised Learning and Sentiment Analysis, I aimed to analyze and visualize people's view of the National Lockdown. 
By doing so, I hoped to achieve a better understanding of what people's opinion was on the Pandemic.

In doing this project, I got a chance to put all that I studied to practical use and I really enjoyed doing so.

This repository contains all files of that project.
